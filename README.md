# Fuelistic - Delivery application Suite

The raw idea behind Fuelistic was to push door-to-door delivery of Diesel in India. This would help industries cut major cost. You can find more about the idea [here](https://linktr.ee/kartikaysharma01). The Project now serves a open software template for similiar delivery applications.
